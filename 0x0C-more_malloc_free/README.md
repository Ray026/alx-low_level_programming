Here I learnt more about dynamic memory allocation. I also had the main.h file that consisted all the prototypes of the tasks I did.
#Tasks#
Write a function that allocates memory using malloc. Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b); Returns a pointer to the allocated memory. if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98
1. string_nconcat: Write a function that concatenates two strings
2. _calloc: Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
3. array_range: Write a function that creates an array of integers.
4. _realloc: Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope: Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
